App for management of group insurance contracts for:
- life insurer
- HR department in a company
- employee

This app has been written as a final work at my CodersLab boot camp which took place in Jan-Feb, 2019.
It is still under development as I aim to make it real prototype that could be used commercially. 

You can login as administrator using 65110605857 as login and aaaa1111 as password. This will give you access to Admin Panel which presents the whole functionality.

I am now working on panel for HR rep, claim processing and doc printing in pdf.
