# grupa_plus

Documentation (in Polish) is available in documentation folder:
- presentation of the app concept
- functional layout
- db structure

App for management of group insurance contracts for:
- life insurer
- HR department in a company
- employee

This app has been written as my final project at CodersLab boot camp which took place in Jan-Feb, 2019.
It is still under development as I aim to make it real prototype that could be used commercially. 

You can login as administrator using: "admin" as login and: "admin" as password. This will give you access to Admin Panel which presents the whole functionality.

You can view current functionality for employee by loging with: "user" and password: "user".

Recent additions allow for pdf creation and email sending.
